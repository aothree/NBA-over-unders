# NBA-over-unders

Every year, Vegas books publish their win-totals and people can bet the 'over' or the 'under'.  For example, the Lakers win-total before the 2021-22 season was 52.5.  If you bet the over, the Lakers would need to win more than 52 games for you to win.  Likewise, betting the under would only win if they won under 53 games.  

The goal of this project is to build a supervised classification model that can predict 'over' or 'under' on NBA season win-totals.  We will try various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc) and pick the best model.  To be a viable model, it must beat the baseline accuracy of 51%.
